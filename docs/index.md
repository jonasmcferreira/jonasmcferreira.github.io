# Hi, i'm Jonas

I'm a software engineer/coder/developer, with a taste for large scale infrastructure and high-level architecture.

Having suffered through my share of Friday deployments, coding in production, and manual testing, I have become obsessed with automating things, so I can sleep well at night.
