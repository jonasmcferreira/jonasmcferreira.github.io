# Hi, i'm Jonas

I'm a software engineer/coder/developer, with a taste for large scale infrastructure and high-level architecture.

Having suffered my share of bad Friday deployments, manual testing processes, and sleepless nights checking for bugs, I've made it a goal to create infrastructures whc8h are low maintenance, automated, highly available and scalable.

I seem to be doing something right, but who knows?
