# :wave: Hi, i'm Jonas 

:technologist: I'm a software engineer/coder/developer , with a taste for large scale infrastructure and high-level architecture. :office:

:computer: I have done deployments on Friday, I have coded straight in production servers, I have made copious amounts of incomplete manual testing, I have accepted a lot of PR's without reviewing.

:sweat_smile: I have also suffered all the consequences, I believe they call that experience.
