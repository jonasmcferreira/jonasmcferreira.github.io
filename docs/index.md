# Hi, i'm Jonas :wave: 

I'm a software engineer/coder/developer :technologist:, with a taste for large scale infrastructure and high-level architecture. :office:

Having suffered through my share of Friday deployments, coding in production, and manual testing, I have become obsessed with automating things:robot_face:, so I can sleep well at night.

I'm on [:fontawesome-brands-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonasferreira/) or [:fontawesome-brands-github:](https://github.com/jonasmcferreira)
